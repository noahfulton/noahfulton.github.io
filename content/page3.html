<h2>God of War 2</h2>
<p>God of War 2's plot is the begining of the fight between Zues and Kratos. Kratos escapes the underworld after being stripped of his power and being killed by Zues. There his plan begins. Kratos travels back in time and allys himself with the titans. He gets back to the time where Zues killed Kratos and attempts to kill Zues. Athena intervenes and dies.
<h3>God of War 3</h3>
<p>Kratos is betrayed by Gaia and falls into the River of Styx. Kratos climbs Mount Olympus slaying all gods who get in his way. Kratos meets Pandora and starts seeing her as a daughter. Pandora sacrofices herself to allow Kratos access to Pandora's box which was empty. Kratos kills Zues and impales himself with the Sword of Olympus to free the power of hope to the remaining humans alive.
<h4>God of War Side Games</h4>
<p>God of War's stories are made to explain plot holes in the story. Chains of Olympus explain another reason why Kratos hates Zues IE killed his brother. The God of War side games are not necessary to the plot of the God of War series.</p>
