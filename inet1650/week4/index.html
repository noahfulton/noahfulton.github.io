<h2>His History</h2>

<article>
<p>Kratos was a spartan general whose power was nearly unmatched, until one fateful day on the battlefield. Kratos was about to die by enemy hands when he made a pact with Ares. <i>"Destroy my enemies and my life is yours."</i> </p>
<p>Kratos has found power through Pandora's box on his quest against Ares. He searches again for the box in God of War 3 and finds the power in <s>the box again</s> within himself.</p>
</article>


<h3 id="startDrive">His Drive</h3>

<p>Kratos is revenge driven. <strong>After Ares <em> tricked Kratos into killing his family,</em></strong> Kratos has sought the death of Ares. Ares sent the Furies to stop him, but it failed. <br> When Kratos finds out that the gods only forgave him of his crime (<small><abbr title="God of War">GOW</abbr> <sup>1</sup></small>), he seeks the death of Zues for not sparing him the memory of his family's murder.</p>
<p>His main at<wbr>tri<wbr>butes are as follows.</p>
<u1>
<li>Furious</li>
<li>Strong</li>
<li>Vengeful</li>
<li>Easily tricked</li>
</u1>


<h4>The Aftermath</h4>

<p>The death of the gods reaks havok upon the land. pestilence, floods, and mass death occur because the gods cannot control their forces. A new Norse world shapes with new gods and monsters, and Kratos is still around to do what he does best.</p>
